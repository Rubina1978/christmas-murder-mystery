        <h1>Mrs Claus</h1>  

        <p>
            Hello, I'm Mrs Claus
            <br> 
            I have always been a faithful wife, despite rumours in 2020 that I had an affair with the head elf.
            <br>
             My favourite thing about Santa is his beard, she likes the way it tickles her when she kiss him.  
            <br>
            she is worried about the large kitchen knife in your kitchen covered in blood.

            She wears a similar costume to Santa, however she wears a skirt and red tights.  
             <br>
             She has large ear muffs to keep her ears warm.

             Most people now think the rumours are not true.  
            <br>
            Apparently she was carving the Christmas turkey with the knife. 
            <br>
            She was last seen in the store shed packing toys onto the sleigh.
