        <h1>The Head Elf</h1>  

        <p>
            Hello, I am the Head Elf.
            <br> 
            I like to keep everyone in order, 
            but it is usually no trouble as all of the elves love working.  
        </p>

        <h2>Their description</h2>
        <p>
            He wears a big red costume, similar to Santa’s but a lot smaller because he's an elf.  
            <br>
            Instead of wearing black boots he has black pointy shoes along with black and white stripy tights.  
            <br>
            He has a big flashy badge which shows he is the head elf.
        </p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
        You loved Santa, but has always envied his job.
